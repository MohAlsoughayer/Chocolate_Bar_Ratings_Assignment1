- Slide 3 and Slide 4: Inconsistent value for the number of individual
 chocolate bars (1,700 ot 2,530).

- Slide 9: bar chart is more appropriate than a density plot since it is an ordinal variable.

 some visualisation for the lowest rating to have a comprehensive idea of what is going on.


- Slide 13: Limit the maximum value of the x-axis to 100 percent since the percentage cant go higher.
